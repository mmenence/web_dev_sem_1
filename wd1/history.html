                Traditionally, the scientific name for the donkey is <i> Equus asinus asinus </i> based on the principle
                of
                priority used for scientific names of animals. However, the <a href="https://www.iczn.org/">
                    <i>International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature</i></a> ruled in 2003 that if the domestic
                species and the wild species are considered subspecies of one another, the scientific name of the wild
                species has priority, even when that subspecies was described after the domestic subspecies. This means
                that
                the proper scientific name for the donkey is <i>Equus africanus asinus</i> when it is considered a
                subspecies and <i>Equus asinus</i> when it is considered a species.

                At one time, the synonym ass was the more common term for the donkey. The first recorded use of donkey
                was
                in either 1784 or 1785. While the word ass has cognates in most other Indo-European languages, donkey is
                an
                etymologically obscure word for which no credible cognate has been identified. Hypotheses on its
                derivation
                include the following:

            <p>

                The genus Equus, which includes all extant equines, is believed to have evolved from <i>Dinohippus</i>,
                via the
                intermediate form <i>Plesippus</i>. One of the oldest species is <i>Equus simplicidens</i>, described as
                zebra-like with a
                donkey-shaped head. The oldest fossil to date is ~3.5 million years old from <i>Idaho, USA</i>. The
                genus
                appears to have spread quickly into the Old World, with the similarly aged <i>Equus livenzovensis</i>
                documented from <i>western Europe</i> and <i>Russia</i>.
                <br>
                Molecular phylogenies indicate the most recent common ancestor of all modern <i>equids</i> (members of
                the
                genus <i>Equus</i>) lived ~5.6 (3.9–7.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old
                middle
                Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 Myr before present date for the
                most recent common ancestor (MRCA) within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 Myr BP. The oldest divergencies are
                the
                Asian <i>hemiones</i> (subgenus E. (<i>Asinus</i>), including the <i>kulan</i>, <i>onager</i>, and
                <i>kiang</i>), followed by the African zebras (subgenera E. (<i>Dolichohippus</i>), and E.
                (<i>Hippotigris</i>)). All other modern forms including the domesticated horse (and many fossil Pliocene
                and
                Pleistocene forms) belong to the subgenus E. (<i>Equus</i>) which diverged ~4.8 (3.2–6.5) million years
                ago.
                <br>
                The ancestors of the modern donkey are the Nubian and Somalian subspecies of African wild ass. Remains
                of
                domestic donkeys dating to the fourth millennium BC have been found in <i>Ma'adi</i> in <i>Lower
                    Egypt</i>,
                and it is believed that the domestication of the donkey was accomplished long after the domestication of
                cattle, sheep and goats in the seventh and eighth millennia BC. Donkeys were probably first domesticated
                by
                pastoral people in <i>Nubia</i>, and they supplanted the ox as the chief pack animal of that culture.
                The
                domestication of donkeys served to increase the mobility of pastoral cultures, having the advantage over
                ruminants of not needing time to chew their cud, and were vital in the development of long-distance
                trade
                across <i>Egypt</i>. In the Dynasty IV era of <i>Egypt</i>, between 2675 and 2565 BC, wealthy members of
                society were known to own over 1,000 donkeys, employed in agriculture, as dairy and meat animals and as
                pack
                animals. In 2003, the tomb of either <i>King Narmer</i> or <i>King Hor-Aha</i> (two of the first
                Egyptian
                pharaohs) was excavated and the skeletons of ten donkeys were found buried in a manner usually used with
                high ranking humans. These burials show the importance of donkeys to the early Egyptian state and its
                ruler.

            <h2>Emergence of modern-day donkeys</h2>
            <img src="donkey-6.jpg" alt="a tired donkey">
            <p>
                By the end of the fourth millennium BC, the donkey had spread to Southwest Asia, and the main breeding
                centre had shifted to Mesopotamia by 1800 BC. The breeding of large, white riding asses made Damascus
                famous, while Syrian breeders developed at least three other breeds, including one preferred by women
                for
                its easy gait. The Muscat or Yemen ass was developed in Arabia. By the second millennium BC, the donkey
                was
                brought to Europe, possibly at the same time as viticulture was introduced, as the donkey is associated
                with
                the Syrian god of wine, Dionysus. Greeks spread both of these to many of their colonies, including those
                in
                what are now Italy, France and Spain; Romans dispersed them throughout their empire.
                <br>
                The first donkeys came to the Americas on ships of the Second Voyage of <i>Christopher Columbus</i>, and
                were landed at <i>Hispaniola</i> in 1495. The first to reach <i>North America</i> may have been two
                animals
                taken to <i>Mexico</i> by <i>Juan de Zumárraga</i>, the first bishop of <i>Mexico</i>, who arrived there
                on
                6 December 1528, while the first donkeys to reach what is now the <i>United States</i> may have crossed
                the
                <i>Rio Grande</i> with <i>Juan de Oñate</i> in April 1598. From that time on they spread northward,
                finding
                use in missions and mines. Donkeys were documented as present in what today is <i>Arizona</i> in 1679.
                By
                the Gold Rush years of the 19th century, the burro was the beast of burden of choice of early
                prospectors in
                the western <i>United States</i>. With the end of the placer mining boom, many of them escaped or were
                abandoned, and a feral population established itself.

            <h2>Miscellaneous facts through history</h2>
            <img src="donkey-3.jpg" alt="another lovely donkey">

            <p>
                During <i>World War I</i> <i>John Simpson Kirkpatrick</i>, a British stretcher bearer serving with the
                Australian and
                New Zealand Army Corps, and <i>Richard Alexander "Dick" Henderson</i> of the New Zealand Medical Corps
                used
                donkeys to rescue wounded soldiers from the battlefield at <i>Gallipoli</i>.

                According to British food writer <i>Matthew Fort</i>, donkeys were used in the Italian Army. The
                Mountain
                Fusiliers each had a donkey to carry their gear, and in extreme circumstances the animal could be
                eaten.

                Donkeys have also been used to carry explosives in conflicts that include the war in <i>Afghanistan</i>
                and
                others.
                <br>
                In some areas domestic donkeys have returned to the wild and established feral populations such as those
                of the burro of <i>North America</i> and the Asinara donkey of <i>Sardinia, Italy</i>, both of which
                have protected
                status. Feral donkeys can also cause problems, notably in environments that have
                evolved free of any form of equid, such as <i>Hawaii</i>. In <i>Australia</i>, where there may be 5
                million feral
                donkeys, they are regarded as an invasive pest and have a serious impact on the environment. They
                may compete with livestock and native animals for resources, spread weeds and diseases, foul or damage
                watering holes and cause erosion.
                <br>
                In <i>China</i>, donkey meat is considered a delicacy with some restaurants specializing in such dishes,
                and
                <i>Guo Li Zhuang</i> restaurants offer the genitals of donkeys in dishes. Donkey-hide gelatin is
                produced by
                soaking and stewing the hide to make a traditional Chinese medicine product.
                <br>
                Donkeys have a notorious reputation for stubbornness, but this has been attributed to a much stronger
                sense of self-preservation than exhibited by horses. Likely based on a stronger prey instinct and a
                weaker connection with humans, it is considerably more difficult to force or frighten a donkey into
                doing something it perceives to be dangerous for whatever reason. Once a person has earned their
                confidence they can be willing and companionable partners and very dependable in work.
